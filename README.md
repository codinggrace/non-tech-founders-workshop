# Introduction
- Going to apologise in advance if parts are pitched at the wrong level and are either confusing or simplistic. Please interrupt to ask questions!
- We have material which we can run through lecture style but would rather people ask questions and we can drive from there. We can use the notes and slides as a structure.
- Different aspects are inspired by questions we've previously answered or problems we've seen.
- Going to try to minimize technical minutia where we can but we might miss the mark!
- We also want to emphasize business or economic decisions where we can
- We are going to publish our material and update based on feedback and questions. This can grow into a useful resource.
- Be warned: it's likely we'll use lots of short hands and industry terms without realizing it! Please stop us and get us to explain!

# Outline
We want this course to build into something useful so we've structured it like this:
1. Networking (how customers talk to your product)
2. Cloud Providers (how you host your product for customers)
3. Source Control (how developers working for you interact with your product at a fundamental level)
4. Secrets and Credential Management (how to ensure your product and customer's data is protected)

# Notes for Editing These Files
- Mick using obsidian.md as an editor, as bit of an experiment
- Mick also uses Deckset for presentations
- Neither of these is required!
