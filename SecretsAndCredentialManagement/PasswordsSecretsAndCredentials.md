# Managing your passwords and credentials

Generally, the best approach to follow with access control is to only give people access to what they need only. And to have a way to remove that access **fast**. 
Even better if you can schedule the access being removed at the end of their contract. This is not only safe for you and your business, it is also safe for them.

Make sure you have in place two things:

* As the business owner, you have the ability to recover whatever you need to **quickly**. For example, access to their company email address, you can simply disable and redirect .
* Where that isn't possible, that a condition of getting the last payment  is the hand-over of all company assets including arranging hand-over of all passwords like Administrator accounts, passwords to routers and network attached devices i.e. anything the user administers for you and that doesn't have an easy reset mechanism you can use. I would ensure this happens before the last day.


An important thing that I really hope you are tired of hearing is: don't use the same password anywhere. 

> Why? 

Loss of sensitive data


* When security breaches happen (they will happen) if you have single use passwords, the risk is to one account, rather than many.
* Can they guess the password with brute force? some places make it very hard to attempt to guess your passwords but it's not always clear where.



## Managing passwords


* Email (never ever share, you can generally recover passwords here)
* Ticketing system
* Design tools (like figma, adobe suite)
* Collaboration tools (Miro, zoom, etc)
* social media

> insert interesting sceal

There are many ways to share access to an online resource. Generally there are ways to have an account per person

It is also possible to share *some* passwords, if you do  use a password manager, such as: LastPass, Dashlane, bitWarden, etc


### Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

* The main idea here is to find some way to verify that you are you. 
* The same idea of banks verifying a transaction by asking you to confirm something on the bank app or using the bank thingymebob

### Data breach

This is definitely something you want to avoid. If it happens the solutions is highly contextual. Not only it depends what is was breached but 

a) Who (people and organisations) do you need to notify? 
b) How are you stopping the problem from happening again? 
do you need to stop trading while this problem is being solved?


### Single Sign On (SSO)

The idea here is that as long as you are signed in to 1 thing, it gives access to a lot of other things

## Critical company secrets (AWS, DNS, GitHub admin credentials)

### AWS and other cloud providers

* They generally allow you to have a root account, you can create other accounts completely free for management. It is worth getting familiar with the process of setting up a root account and understanding the basics of identity management. The same principles will apply for a lot of important tooling

* Github

* DNS/ web hosting.
