# Managing your passwords and credentials

Generally, the best approach to follow with access control is to only give people access to what they need. And to have a way to remove that access **fast**, even better if you can schedulle the access being removed on the end of their contract. This is not only safe for you, it is safe for them.
It's worth  thinking about what happens if an attacker compromises the account too.  
 ake sure you have in place two things:

* As the business owner, you have the ability to recover whatever you need to **quickly**. For example, access to your office server you can simply as an administrator disable the account, so you're covered.
* Where that isn't possible, that a condition of getting the last payment  is the hand-over of all company assets including arranging hand-over of all passwords like Administrator accounts, passwords to routers and network attached devices i.e. anything the user administers for you and that doesn't have an easy reset mechanism you can use. I would ensure this happens before the last day.

don't use the same password everywhere

## Managing passwords


* Email
* Ticketing system

* collaboration tools (Miro, zoom, etc)
* social media

-> horror stories

There are many ways to share access to an online resource. Generally there are ways to have an account per person

It is also possible to share some passwords, if you do it is a good idea to use a password manager, such as: LastPass, Dashlane, bitWarden, etc


## Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

* main idea is find some way to check that you are you 
* The same idea of banks verifying a transaction by asking you to confirm something on the bank app or using the bank thingymebob

data breach

* Enforce extra security protocols to reduce the risk of a successful data breach.
* Increase IT control with contextual MFA policies, from geofencing to IP address policies.
* Improve security without impacting employee productivity. 


## Single Sign On (SSO)

The idea here is that as long as you are signed in to 1 thing, it gives access to a lot of other things

## Managing critical company secrets (AWS, DNS, GitHub admin credentials)
## Managing shared MFA
## Physical MFA tokens
## Protecting yourself and your business from attacks
