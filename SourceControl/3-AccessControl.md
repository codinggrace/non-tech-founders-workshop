## How to keep access control

- Even if you are not writing code, you should have a github/bitbucket/gitlab account. Eventually you can turn this personal account into an organisation, when it's necessary
- Any programmer who has access to your git repository will have a copy of the code, if you remove access to this person from github, they might still have a copy of it. You need to ask them to delete the code when they stop working with you.
