## What are source control tools in use today?

The most popular source control solution is `git`, yes it is a terrible name. It is also more complicated that needs to be (other simpler systems have been invented) however it is the most popular, that means everyone knows how to use it... it is a *de facto* standard. 

It is also very bad at large files (so if you are doing games or media, you might need a different source control tool)

Still, you might be wondering why we use git:

- The real answer to that is `github` , a popular platform where the code is saved.
- It is decentralised: people who have access to you code can get full local copies so that they can make changes and push them up the stream. This does mean that they have a full copy of the code (including history) in their computer. (if you use a contractor it is worth adding a clause about this)
