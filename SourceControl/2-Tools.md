# Source control tools in use today?

The most popular source control solution is `git`

## Pros

* It's the *de facto* standard. So all professionals knows how to use it.
* Decentralised

### Cons 

* More complicated that needs to be (other simpler systems have been invented).
* Not a great name. 
* Not great at large files. If you are doing games or other media heavy projects, you might need a different source control tool


Still, you might be wondering why we use git: Github 

The real answer to that is based on the evolution of source control. When `github` came about it solved a lot of the problems other source control management systems couldn't and it did it in a very nice (and cheap) way. 
Github is a popular platform where the code is saved. There are others (Bitbucket, Gitlab, etc) but Github has the lion's share of the market.

It is decentralised: people who have access to your code can get full local copies so that they can make changes and push them up the stream. This does mean that they have a full copy of the code (including history) in their computer. (if you use a contractor it is worth adding a clause about this)
