# Source control


# What is source control?

It is like a bank for your code. It helps coordinating work among multiple people.  How? 

- knowing what changed and when
- who changed it so that we can understand the context of the change

It also helps with safe keeping, since you can control who can modify code.

# Why is this useful, can't I just Dropbox, google drive, etc?

You might wonder why not use something easier such as Dropbox for code.

Dropbox and other remote storage solutions are great for some things, but if you are trying to store code, very soon you will need source control. 

Why?  It gets really painful when things are moving faster, especially if you loose the "right" version of it due to file naming like:


final.bak

final_do_not_delete.bak

final_do_not_delete(1).bak

final_do_not_delete(2).bak

ThisOne.bak
