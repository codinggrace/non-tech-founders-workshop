# Common Cloud Providers

Here are some of the best known cloud providers (in alphabetical order):
- Alibaba Cloud
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- DigitalOcean
- Google Cloud
- Heroku
- IBM Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

Not all of these are equivalent and not all offer directly comparable services.

## Caveat
A lot of the following is based on personal experience, following the industry, anecdotal infromation and opinion. Through chance you might fail catastrophically hosting on a recommended providers below, while succeeding on one of the others. Nothing is certain and the choice of cloud provider might not dictate success (or failure).

## The 3 Major Cloud Providers
- Amazon AWS
- Google Cloud
- Microsoft Azure

It's likely AWS is an order of magnitude larger that the rest.

## Which Should You Choose?
If you are completely unsure AWS is the safest choice. They aren't the cheapest, nor the nicest to use but they will always have capacity for your business and offer the biggest selection of services (not to mention being pretty much the original cloud provider). 

Amazon hosts everything on AWS, which helps to improve it massively.

If you use a lot of Microsoft products and already have a relationship with them, Azure is a very good choice. It's improving rapidly and will likely be a serious contender to AWS at some point.

Microsoft is moving rapidly to hosting everything on Azure, which helps improve it massively.

Google offers a smaller selection of services, but is generally regarded as better integrated. If their services line up well with what you need it's likely you'll have a reasonably good experience with them. However they've developed a strong reputation for shutting down and replacing services frequently. I've personally had to rewrite the same service over three times just because they kept deprecating the version of the stack I was using.

Google does not host much on Google Cloud, their own infrastructure is pretty much separate. This leads to quite a few problems, one being the platform just doesn't seem as tested as the others.

## What About The Others?
Heroku has a great reputation for very simple hosting of applications. Many businesses start on Heroku and achieve success without hiring any infrastructure engineers.

DigitalOcean specializes in cheaper, basic hosting options. They are a particularly good choice for someone comfortable with networking and operating systems.

IBM and Oracle tend not to have great reputations within the industry for Cloud hosting. I wouldn't recommend them unless you already have a good relationship with them. I suspect you'll get better deals with Google or Microsoft.
