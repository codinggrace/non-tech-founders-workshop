# Software as a Service
A close relation to cloud providers is Software as a Service (SaaS). You're probably using some right now (Zoom is one if you squint at it right).

Instead of renting some computer time, installing and configuring a database, operating the database, learning how to back it up, how to recover it when something goes wrong, and how to hate your life for spending all your time looking after a silly database, why not rent it from someone?

This is the next step up from cloud computing, renting a more complete service from someone, usually itself running on a cloud provider.
