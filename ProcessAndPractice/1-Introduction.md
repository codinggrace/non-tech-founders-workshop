# Process and practices

Some common vocabulary 
## Agile 

There are many practices that derive from the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org):

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

It is hard to recommend a protocol here, pretty much every company do this in their own way. Most of them at least have a Standup, use task boards and do retrospectives but even saying this is probably contentious.

## eXtreme Programming (XP)

A lot of the things many companies do today come from the practice of XP, or extreme programming.  This is where the popularisation of testing, pair programming, stand up meetings, etc started.
