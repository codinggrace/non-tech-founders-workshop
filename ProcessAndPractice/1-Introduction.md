# Process and practices

Some common vocabulary 
## Agile 

There are many practices that derive from the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org):

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

It is hard to recommend a protocol here, pretty much every company do this in their own way. Most of them at least have a Standup, use task boards and do retrospectives but even saying this is probably contentious.

Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

## Continuos Delivery

> Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.

> Youâ€™re doing continuous delivery when: [1]
>
>    * Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
>    * Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
    Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
    You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand
