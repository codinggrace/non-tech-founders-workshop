## Workshop Blub
Coding Grace are running a Tech Basics for Founders workshop which takes place on Tue Mar 29 and Wed Mar 30 at 08:00 - 10:00 each morning.

The workshop aims to demystify tech and provide foundational knowledge in areas including access control, source control, cloud technologies, networking. This will help founders make more informed decisions when it comes to discussing tech in their products or services, and hiring tech talent such as CTO and tech lead.

Limited places available to ensure a small workshop, and participants have as much engagement with the facilitators to ask questions and for advice.

The workshop is remote and will be held over zoom, and will not be recorded.
